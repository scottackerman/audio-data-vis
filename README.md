# Audio Data Visualization Experiment
Done using Processing including the OpenGL and Krister ESS audio libraries (included). Screen capture of this project can be seen here - http://vimeo.com/71616190

## Description
Data visualization of audio from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon as the data source and the album art for the visual reference. Frequencies are mapped to colors (higher frequencies = brighter colors) line lengths are drawn based on amplitude of those frequencies. Rendered in 3d space, the camera pans the x and y axes based on the mouse x and y positions.

## Necessary Libraries
Drop the contents of the 'drop-contents-in-libs-folder' into your processing library folder.

## Controls
Mouse position controls x and y axes, arrow buttons control same. 
After clicking on stage, 1 key = half size image, 2 key = full size image, 3 key draws thin frequency lines, 4 key draws medium frequency lines, 5 key draws thick lines, 6 key draws very thick lines, and 7 key draws ridiculously thick lines.

## BIG FILE ALERT:
Audio file is .aif and rather large (34MB).
